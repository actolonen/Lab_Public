# Complex medium for growth of *Clostridium acetobutylicum*

## 2xYTG 

Prepare 1 liter of 2xYTG (see [Reference](https://sharebiology.com/2x-yt-medium/))

-   16 g tryptone

-   10 g yeast extract

-   5 g NaCl

-   5 g glucose
   
-   Add 900 ml H2O

-   Adjust to pH 5.2

-   Adjust volume to 1 L
  
-   Add 1 ml of Resazurin 0.1%

- Add 2g cysteine HCl

-   Autoclave or filter. The medium can be sterilized by autoclave or filtration. To store autoclaved media, close the bottle tightly to keep it reduced. If medium is filtered, transfer to the glove box to reduce.

## 1xYTG: used for Genemat experiments

-   8 g tryptone

-   5 g yeast extract

-   2.5 g NaCl

-   2.5 g glucose
   
-   Add 900 ml H2O

-   Adjust to pH 5.2

-   Adjust volume to 1 L

-   Add 1 ml of Resazurin 0.1%

-   Add 2g cysteine HCl (NOTE: cysteine is added to medium for the Genemat after autoclaving/filtration)

-   Autoclave or filter. The medium can be sterilized by autoclave or filtration. To store autoclaved media, close the bottle tightly to keep it reduced. If medium is filtered, transfer to the glove box to reduce.
